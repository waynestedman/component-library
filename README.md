# We need a rating component!
Imagine you're a developer on the design systems team and you're being tasked with creating a new star rating component. You get the designs below from the designer on the team and are told that the component must be accessible, tested, documented and work in the majority of browsers (Edge, Chrome, Firefox and Safari Mobile/Safari Desktop).

## Constraints for the solution
* You must utilize web-components. We can recommend e.g. https://lit.dev/ The included boilerplate is using Lit, but feel free to use any other framework to solve the case.
* All files and code must be uploaded to your public GitHub repository (or something similar) 
* We recommend usage of CSS variables for star color.


## Delivery expectations
* Accessibility has been prioritized.
* Keyboard and mouse support is available.
* An oral presentation of the solution no more than 20 minutes. Include an explanation about decisions, reflections and possible limitations of the solution.

## What we are looking for
* Code structure and readability
* Solid domain knowledge of web development
* Analytical skills and a prioritized approach to delivering the best possible outcome.
* Being able to work structured under time pressure
* Communication and presentation skills
